# About Me (Brace Yourself 🤪)

- **Name:** Санжар (AKA "The Procrastinator Extraordinaire" 🤹‍♂️)
- **Location:** Somewhere between existential dread and panic attacks 😱🌪️
- **Languages:** Fluent in C++, Kazakh, and the art of existential crisis 🧠💻🇰🇿
- **Current Projects:**
  - *Kazakh Uprisings at 3AM* - Writing 7-page papers while screaming at my screen about C++ and wondering why I didn't start sooner 🖥️📚🕒
  - *Soviet-Era Plot Twists* - Trying to make sense of the USSR, while my brain melts into a puddle of confusion 🧠🔥🔴
  - *Ethics on the Internet: A Meltdown* - Navigating online culture while fighting the urge to throw my laptop out the window 🌐💣💻
- **Tech I’m Battling With:**
  - C++: *Seriously, why are you so obsessed with functions?* 😤💢💥
  - Python (I’m pretending to understand it, but really I’m just winging it) 🐍💨
  - GitHub: Trying to organize this chaotic mess, but it’s just chaos within chaos 📂🔥🌀
- **Favorite Fuel:** 
  - Caffeine: The lifeblood of my academic “success” ☕🔥💀
  - Cursed memes: They keep my soul alive, barely 👹😜
  - Academic adrenaline: Running on pure panic and last-minute essays 💥💀📚
- **Philosophy:** My GPA? It’s Schrödinger’s cat—it’s alive, it’s dead, it’s probably screaming for help somewhere 🐱📦😭
- **Random Thoughts:** Kazakh uprisings? Fun. Soviet history? A mind-bender. Writing papers at 3AM? Classic me. 🤡📚⏰
- **Bonus Fact:** I once tried to write a paper on Kazakh history, ended up reading about famines, uprisings, and Stalin. Probably lost some brain cells in the process 🤯📖💔
